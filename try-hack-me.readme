2. Access the transfer page.
3. Transfer **$2000** from account **2276** to your account **8881**.
4. Confirm your new balance.

## 🔍 Step 2 — Directory Enumeration
Use [Gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster) to find directories.

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://fakebank/ -w wordlist.txt
````

✅ **Expected findings:**

```
